# Intro to Deep Learning
This week we are going to dive into Deep Learning 

1. Strongly suggest you to go through "Introduction to Deep Learning" under Neural Networks and Deep Learning Specialisation in coursera by Andrew NG.
2. Read Both the research papers namely "CNN-LSTM.pdf" and "DeepCNN.pdf". 
3. Submit detailed summary of the paper that you would like to implement for the final project submission. 
4. You may also implement some other paper taking approval from us.
5. If you want to learn about CNN refer "Convolutional Neural Networks" under Neural Networks and Deep Learning Specialisation in coursera by Andrew NG.
6. If you want to learn about Sequence Model refer "Sequence Models" under Neural Networks and Deep Learning Specialisation in coursera by Andrew NG.
7. If you need extra resources contact us.
