In order to work with dates, you should get to know more about the datetime library of Python from [here](https://thispointer.com/python-how-to-convert-datetime-object-to-string-using-datetime-strftime/) (Especially the datetime.strftime() function) and about the [datetime.timedelta()](https://www.studytonight.com/python-howtos/how-to-add-days-to-date-in-python) function.\n",
